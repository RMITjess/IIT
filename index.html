					<h1>About</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Hello World! My name is Jessica Bayly and I am an Information Technology student at RMIT University. I was born and raised in Sydney, Australia in a traditional middle-class family with roots from the French Islands of La Réunion and New Caledonia, and am currently building my forever after with a wonderful partner and three step-children in Adelaide. I have a passion for reading and am often involved in online book challenges and following #bookstagrammers. I enjoy analysing a good crime documentary and on wekeends, you'll find me exploring the beautiful regions of South Australia with a GoPro. </p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Information Technology has always been a big part of my life, from playing video games on the Atari, Nintendo and Sega as a young child to understanding audio/visual input devices and having a basic understanding of the architecture of computers  and how it all pieces together.</p>
						
				  <p>My passion shifted a little when my parents allowed us to have an internet connection. This was in 1997 and 12-year-old me was very much a teenybopper obsessed with a band called Hanson. You may remember the song <i>Mmmbop</i>. My love for them meant wanting to download music, videos and pictures, even if it took 3 days on my crappy dial-up connection. I became familiar with chat clients such as mIRC and ICQ just to talk to other fans. This lead me down the path of wanting to build a fan website, so I began learning how to build simple pages with the help of htmlgoodies.com.</p>
				  <p>I'm 36-years-old now and although I currently work in digital media, I always wished I had gone down a different path because of my love for  coding and troubleshooting. I realised it wasn't too late and so after researching different study options online, I decided that RMIT provided the kind of degree structure that works for me. I am a full-time employee and the requirement hours per week fits in perfectly with my busy schedule. </p>
				  <p>The subjects within the Information Technology Bachelor and Bachelor of Computer Science degrees appeal to my ideal job and the learning outcomes such as solving ICT problems, applying critical analysis and being able to communicate effectively seemed like the right choice for me. I believe learning these important skills alongside technical abilities that will enable me to seek experience in my chosen field in the future. </p>

					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>The Google and Windows System Engineer is an appealing position for me as it will require me to gain the technical skills in areas I find interesting such as Azure Virtual Machines and Cloud Storage as well as the ability to identify issues and troubleshoot them accordingly. I like the idea of being part of a small  team that provides solutions to educational institutions. This gives me a sense of ...being able to contribute to the importance of digital technologies in the classroom.					</p>
					<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
					<p>The skills needed for this position will require me to have more coding skills and a deep understanding and experience working with VMWare, Nutanix, Commvault and Hardware racking and stacking. I will also need to advance my current skills of Microsoft Stack and Google G-Suite if I were to be successful in a role like this one. </p>

					<h3>Results</h3>
                    <p>Not entirely surprised with the results of the three tests taken that outline I am an introvert and my mental energy is observant. I was a little surprised that my nature is more emotional feelings, but on reflection I can see how that makes sense. When reading the outline of the Defender personality having excellent analytical abilities and receptive to change and new ideas but also needing to know when to say no and stand up for themselves, made me chuckle as I have been told this many times before in my personal and work life.</p>
                    <h3>Behaviour influence in a team</h3>
                    <p>I am less likely to be the leader or strong outspoken personality in a team as I am more reserved and internalised with my opinions and will sit back and analyse before presenting my thoughts and opinions later. I can handle change of direction when its decided and even though at times can procrastinate, will give my best at a high standard.</p>
                  <h3>Forming a team</h3>
                    <p>When forming a team I should seek out team members with opposing & complimentary personality traits.  As it is not practical to have other potential team members complete a profile test I will need to use my understanding of my own profile as a basis to judge others traits.  For example knowing that I am introverted and observant, I would be best seeking others that I believe or observe to be more extroverted and forward / open with their discussions of their ideas.  The opposing personality traits should balance to provide more rounded and better considered outputs than if all team members have similar profiles.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>My project idea is an app that will provide Australian adults with clear and concise advice on what path to take to either upskill in their current job role or completely change career paths and/or learn new skills with TAFE and Uni opportunities. It will require the use of a lot of personal and sensitive information and this may require a good strategy so that users can trust in the product that their information is protected. A development team with various skills will be needed for the app to be deployed and successful. </p>
</article>

				<article>
				  <h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>According to the ING Future Focus Report released late May 2020, 3.3 million Australian adults are rethinking their career paths in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The report highlighted that 32% of people would find work opportunities hard to come by and 28% learning new skills in isolation to either progress in their careers or change their career path entirely. I spoke to a few colleagues and thought of my own experiences when signing up to online courses or upskilling in my current position and there was a general feeling of confusion, waste of money and frustration of how we get to where we want to be. This made me think of developing an app that would incorporate various online tools to gather data in one place to provide an outcome of which direction to go in, what skills are needed and whether to begin education in TAFE or Uni.</p>
</article>
				
				<article>
				  <h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The project should be a simple data sharing app using an algorithm that aggregates useful information on an individual&rsquo;s person&rsquo;s identity, interests, attitude, current skills, ambitions and then provides an outcome of the path that individual should take in their career or study, whether it be further study or a simple course at TAFE that suits their current lifestyle, financial situation and skillset. </p>
                    <p>The app will use information from various sources that the user will either have a profile with or has interacted with before. Custom applications and API&rsquo;s such as Myers Briggs personality test, study records, current employment information including job description, social media accounts, skills obtained, seek.com.au, TAFE and Uni courses available; will need to be used to connect all the components and then crawl all the information to create the outcome for the end-user that will enable them to make confident and cost-efficient choices on their careers. </p>
                  <p>The app will be easy to navigate with usability at the forefront of design as the user experience will determine the success of the app. If doesn&rsquo;t have simplicity, then users will not want to use it and so the below features are an important aspect of how this app will need to run. </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Easy navigation with usability at the forefront of the design. </li>
                    <li>Easy sign up process with social integration, allowing users to stay engaged and also share information across various platforms.</li>
                    <li>Security will be an important feature of the app as there will be personal and sensitive information about the user.</li>
                    <li>Geolocation integration will provide the user with directions or nearby institutions/office buildings that </li>
                    <li>Run multiple tests and QA so that the app is always reliable</li>
                    <li>Ability for users to provide feedback so that the development team can troubleshoot accordingly.</li>
                    <li>Push Notifications so that users can see if there is a Job, Study Course or any other opportunity available in their area. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                </article>

				  <h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>If this project was successful, then we will be able to solve many issues Australians face when deciding what they want to do with their life. These issues can be thousands of dollars in study debt, avoiding mental health problems by accepting a job that doesn&rsquo;t really fit with your values or skillset and feeling stuck there as you gear it will not look good on your resume to leave. The intention of the app is to give users a more positive outlook on career and study opportunities and reduce anxiety about whether change is possible or not, no matter what stage or age you are at.</p>
